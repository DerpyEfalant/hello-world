# hello-world

I'm completely new to the programming community, or I have at least touched on JavaScript in Junior High. What's the best programming language to start? I was told C++, or either C.

I have started getting back to computer programming, not only as a passion, but also to initiate my project.

I'm planning to make a computer application for tutoring. I recalled how colllaboration was great when I first joined the MtG community, helping me with building up to competitive brews. Now I consider my self to be a decent player, and I'd like to apply my deck building skills into computer programming.

Anyways, I hope to get some help, and I should stop talking. :)

(Btw, I started teaching myself with freeCodeCamp.com. Is there any better alternatives; I'd like to lean towards C, or C++)
